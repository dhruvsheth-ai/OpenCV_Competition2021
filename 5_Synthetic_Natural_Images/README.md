# Synthetic Natural Images

Due to publishing limitations, the source code for the synthetic image generation is not publicly accessible. Instead, the generated datasets, necessary for the CNN model training and validation, [have been published](https://github.com/precision-sustainable-ag/OpenCV_Competition2021/wiki/Data-Availability). 

To get started, download the [training](https://vision.eng.au.dk/?download=/data/oakd/2021/train.zip) and [validation](https://vision.eng.au.dk/?download=/data/oakd/2021/val.zip) dataset. For further information, as well as an example, please [see here](https://github.com/precision-sustainable-ag/OpenCV_Competition2021/wiki/5.-Synthetic-Natural-Images).
